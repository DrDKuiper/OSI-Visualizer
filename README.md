# OSI Visualizer
## Overview

The OSI Visualizer is a web application designed to visualize the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model in real-time. It fetches network packet data from a backend server and displays the data interactively, helping users understand the flow and structure of network communication.

**Features**

- Visualizes the OSI model layers.

- Displays real-time packet data.

- Easy-to-understand interface for network analysis.

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js and npm:** Ensure you have Node.jsand npm installed on your machine.

- **Python 3:** Required for the backend server.

- **Flask:** Python web framework to handle API requests.

# Getting Started
## Backend Setup

- Navigate to the Backend directory:
```
sh
cd Backend
```
> Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```
sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate 
```
> On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

## Install the dependencies:
```
sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Run the Flask server:
```
sh
python app.py
```
> The backend server should now be running on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

# Frontend Setup
- Navigate to the FrontEnd directory:
```
sh
cd ../FrontEnd
```
## Install the dependencies:
```
sh
npm install
```
## Start the development server:
```
sh
npm run dev
```
> The frontend should now be running on http://<your-ip>:3000 (if you've changed the default port).

# Accessing the Application

## Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://<your-ip>:3000 to view the OSI Visualizer.
```
# Usage

- The application fetches packet data from the backend every 5 seconds.

- The LayerView component displays the OSI model layers.

- The PacketTable component lists the packets received from the backend.
